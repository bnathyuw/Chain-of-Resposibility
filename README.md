# Chain of Responsibility

This project is an implementation of a fairly standard coin-sorter CoR problem.

The key goals are a) to make it clear that the consumer doesn’t know it’s dealing with 
a CoR (it just sees a plain Strategy Pattern), and b) to get StructureMap to do all
the wiring. So far it’s going well!
